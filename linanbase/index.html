      <p>A transaction is a regular part of a personâ€™s daily life. This is true for every place where transactions decide whether a company, group or a person earns or loses money in exchange for a product or service he or she is offered to or offers in return. Recording the daily transactions of a business is essential to keep track of the growth of the money invested in it.</p>
      <p>In this case a company or a store would need to use a specific system to keep track of the sales on a day to day basis. These kinds of systems need specific requirements as per the need of the company. For the customers, this also provides a secure and reliable way for transactions since the transaction is then recorded. The system should have the capability to record items, date as well as the transaction.</p>
      <p>One of the solutions to this sort of problem was created in 1986 which is called a Point of Sale system. A system that features an easy to use touch screen widget driven interface that allows for easier transactions both for the customer as well as the one managing said transaction.</p>
      <p>Through a POS system, the seller as well as the customer is granted an easy way for transactions to occur. This is because a seller has easy access to the array of items he has if they are recorded in the system and the customer has the transaction recorded. Without a POS system, these transactions are less safe and less convenient both for the customer as well as the seller.</p>
